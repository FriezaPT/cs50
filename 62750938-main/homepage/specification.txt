HTML tags:

<p>
<span>
<img>
<strong>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
<div>

CSS properties:
height
width
color
background-color
border
border-color
margin

I chose to use bootstrap for a image carousel and some formatting, and used javascript to create a contact form (that does not actually send an email but the code is commented out).
